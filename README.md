# Face-DetectionAndRecognition-project

##Face Detection:
###1. Install required libraries and import them.
###2. OpenCV is used  to apply its deep neural networks (dnn) module.
###3. Here weâ€™ll loop over the detections and draw boxes around the detected faces and confidence of those faces are mentioned.
###4. For webcam detection I have imported three additional packages- VideoStream , imutils , and time.


##Face Recognition:
###1. I have first detected faces.
###2. Now computing 128-d face embeddings to quantify a face
###3. Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on top of the embeddings
###4. Recognizing faces in images and video streams


##RESULT

###We have successfully performed face detection and recognition task.
###Below are the attached images as a result we got from our system.
